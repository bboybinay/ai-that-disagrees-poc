Streamlit POC for 'AI That Disagrees With You (Intelligently)'
Files created in: /mnt/data/agentic_poc

To run locally:
1. (Optional) create a virtualenv and `pip install streamlit`
2. Run: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
3. The app will open in your browser; paste decisions and demo the disagreement flow.

Notes:
- The app runs in mock mode by default; to enable OpenAI integration, set OPENAI_API_KEY and install openai.
- For the panel, consider recording a short walkthrough or running live with one presenter and one technical backup.
